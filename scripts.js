/*
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Snapchat.

Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.

The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.

For example, given [(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)], you should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)].

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#form-1').submit(function(){
    event.preventDefault()
    let input1 = $('#input-1').val()
    input1 = input1.replace(/\'/g,'"')  //JSON.parse does not like single quotes for arrays
    input1 = JSON.parse(input1)
    event.preventDefault()
    $('#output-1').text(elimArr(input1))

  })
});
